    <description>The Highway Materials Group (HMG), comprised of national associations representing companies that provide the construction materials and equipment essential to building America’s transportation infrastructure, urges Congress in a letter to enact a long-term, robust and sustainable funding mechanism that addresses the Highway Trust Fund shortfall.

Specifically, HMG is looking for Highway Trust Fund solutions that both stabilize and increase highway investments to position America’s economy for the future.

HMG’s letter, addressed to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California), Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland), was delivered as Congress begins efforts to reform the tax code for the first time in a generation.

“With President Trump’s goal of investing a trillion dollars in infrastructure and reforming the tax code, there is an opportunity to provide robust and long-term fixes to both the funding and financing mechanisms for infrastructure investment,” the letter reads.</description>

    <title>Workplace exams rule to be re-examined</title>

    <description>The Mine Safety & Health Administration‘s (MSHA) rule on workplace exams may be getting a makeover.

According to the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association (NSSGA), MSHA is proposing to rework the rule so exams occur “before work begins, or as miners begin work in that place.”

Also, MSHA is proposing an extension of the rule’s effective date from Oct. 2 of this year to March 2, 2018 to accommodate comments and discussion on the rule.

“NSSGA and aggregates operations have consistently raised concerns with the previous workplace examination rule, and it appears that MSHA is willing to listen to the industry,” says Laura O’Neill-Kaumo, NSSGA senior vice president of government and regulatory affairs.

The workplace exams rule, as previously proposed, mandated that exams be conducted before work starts, according to NSSGA.

In addition, as part of the rule’s continued development, MSHA reduced the number of required items for inclusion in the rule’s documentation section, NSSGA says. The rule previously called for producers to document all hazards and their abatements. The revised rule asks producers to document only hazards that are not abated promptly. In this case, “promptly” means “before miners are potentially exposed to adverse conditions,” NSSGA adds.</description>
